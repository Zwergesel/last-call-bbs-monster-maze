## How to play

![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/S5hFiVc.jpg)

The game contains 48 levels in which you must wander through the maze and collect all gems without being eaten by a monster. The monsters move two spaces after each of your moves but they are stupid and only want to move closer to you as if the maze walls weren't there. If they could move both horizontally and vertically closer to you, they will always choose the horizontal move. If both directions that would take them closer to you are blocked by walls, they don't move at all.

In some levels there are gates which can be opened and closed by walking onto buttons. Both the player and the monsters can activate the buttons by stepping onto them. Buttons can be activated multiple times and will always close all open gates and open all closed gates simultaneously.

If a monster catches you, you can restart the level by pressing 'R'. You can also undo your previous moves by pressing 'U' at any time, even after you've been caught.

There's a scoring system based on the number of moves it takes you to finish each level. Three stars is the best score for each level and means you found the shortest possible solution. You can see your stats by pressing the 'S' key. If you want to see the shortest solution that you've found so far for a level, press 'X' to show a replay. You can interrupt the replay at any point by pressing 'Enter', 'Esc' or 'X' again.

Your progress is saved automatically.
